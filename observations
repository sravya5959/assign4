Observations:
1.	The address of the global variables(a,b,c) is the same in all the threads.
2.	The address of the local variables(i,j,k) is different in all the threads.
Explaination:
A programâ€™s virtual memory space is divided into segments called text, data, stack and heap. During multi-threading , 
all the segments except the stack are shared between the threads. The global variables and static variables in the program 
are stored in data segment. Therefore, global variables a,b,c  in the program have same address on virtual memory. 

Functions when called allocate space on the stack. As each of the threads have separate virtual memory space for stack ,
the local variables I,j,k have different addresses in different threads
